    "### A Crash Course with Reusable Code Template in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas library has emerged as one of the most important data wrangling and processing tools for Python developers and data professionals. It allows users to quickly apply data wrangling tasks such as handling missing data, removing duplicate records, merging multiple datasets, and so on. Therefore, the Pandas library has become a must-have tool in the data science toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of articles, we provide a crash course to get you started using the Pandas library. The course is designed to be a practical guide with real-life examples of the most common data manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is this Course for\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is for aspiring data professionals and Python developers who want to learn how to process data in Pandas. We assume you already have a minimum working knowledge about Python programming language and are comfortable running data science documents using Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the examples in this course, you can copy and paste the code snippets into your Jupyter notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes Pandas Special\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an open-source, free (under a [BSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)) Python library originally written by [Wes McKinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_McKinney). It is a high-level data structure and manipulation tool designed to make data analysis and wrangling fast and easy. The library offers a variety of functions and methods to transfer different data sources into a tabular format. In this format, each record is housed on one row and each column contains a unique data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Developers and Data Professionals can upload data from a variety of data sources such as SQL Databases, API JSON format, CSV files as well as native Python data structures like lists and dictionaries. This flexibility makes Pandas suitable for a wide range of applications. Among them are machine learning modeling, data visualization, and time series forecasting. The versatile structure also makes it easy to integrate pandas with other libraries such as scikit-learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early [releases of Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) DataFrame dated back to 2011 with Pandas version 1.0 released in January 2020."

Pandas DataFrame object is a two-dimensional labeled structure that can hold data in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet file or relational database table.

    "Data professionals often need to combine different data sources for analysis projects. For example, if you are working on a data science project to analyze how sports games impact food and beverage sales, you may need to collect several datasets such as game timetables, sports teams’ performance, sports venues, and capacity, as well as sales figures for multiple vendors. \n",

    "So far in this course, we have learned about many of the features that make Pandas one of the most popular data analysis and manipulation libraries. An essential part of any data analysis project is to perform a comprehensive exploratory analysis to help understand underlying patterns among the dataset variables.\n",

    "* **Chart Visualization**: Graphical representation of data using graphs such as histograms, pie charts, box plots, and so on. \n",
    "* **Table Visualization**: Graphical representation of data using HTML styling option within Pandas DataFrame objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas chart visualization can be achieved using the plot() method on Series and DataFrame objects. The function includes several parameters to identify the needed chart type as well as the targeted data columns. In this series of examples, we will use the plot() function to create some popular chart types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series is one of the most commonly used charts to represent numerical values that change over a defined period of time. We can see this type of chart in visualizing financial market data like sales and price movement. In the Pandas library, the plot() method can be applied to a Series object with index values representing date values. Note that the line chart is the default type in the plot() method. Therefore, we do not need to change the type parameter. The following example demonstrates how a time series plot is used for visualization as shown in the example below:"
